# Ark-Stat-Calculator
This program is the most accurate representation I could think of how Ark assigns dino stats (assuming it´s a fair distribution). Be aware that I´m a complete novice at coding, and so code might be a little cringey
I didn´t compile the program and the only file that you need is the .py file.
You will need the PyIntPlus module to be installed.
The program basically determines how many points the dino has for leveling up.
The script will ask you everything it needs, just answer the question and select how many simulations you want the script to run.
Be aware that if the distribution you are trying to do is a very unlikely one it will need some time to complete all the iterations
